## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue framework


### What I learned

As a beginer with [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework, I have learnt more about vueJs component structure, the vue router system and the state management system with pinia.
The state management system is awesome is easy to learn and implement. Also, design navigations with the router is easier as your can add small line of code to get what you want.

### Useful resources

- [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) - This helped me for building the components. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [vue router](https://router.vuejs.org/) - This is an amazing docs which helped me finally understand navigation system in vue application. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) - A state management system with comprehensive docs. easier to learn and implement.
